                <dl>
                    <dt>Describe the purpose of an Interactive Development Environment (IDE).</dt>
                    <dd>a.Using IDE, like VS Code, makes programming more efficent and easy to maintain.</dd>
                    <dd>b.It is a good way to organize your files and we can get access to several programming languages in one software or environment.</dd>
                    <dt>Define the purpose of a Source control</dt>
                    <dd>a.The common source control system is Git, you can use Github or Gitlab to save, manage, and update files.</dd>
                    <dd>b.We can do team works with git. It also allows programmers working with different devices and always get the latest version in hand.  </dd>

                <dl>
                    <dt>What three programming languages are required to generate a web page?</dt>
                    <dd>They are HTML, CSS and Javascript.</dd>
                    <dt>What is the purpose of writing pseudocode in software engineering?</dt>
                    <dd>The purpose of using pseudocode is that it is easier for people to understand.</dd>
                    <dt>Write pseudocode for a for loop that calculates the sum of all integers from 0 to 9.</dt>
                    <dd></dd>    
                    <dt>Describe the purpose of a function in software engineering.</dt>
                    <dd>Function helps us to solve more complicated problems, and it can be used multiple times.</dd>
                    <dt>Describe the purpose of a library in software engineering.</dt>
                    <dd>I heard about React, it makes programming more easier.</dd>
