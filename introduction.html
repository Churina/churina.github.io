                            <strong>Academic background:</strong> I got my phd degree in 2009. After that I worked as a professor in a Chinese University. When I moved to the US, I noticed I needed to change my career. So being a software engineer is my goal in this country!

                            <strong>Funny/Interesting item about yourself:</strong> I used to be a vegetarian, but my husband keeps saying "you have to eat meat because meat can provide you with necessary nutrients". As a result, I am eating some chicken and fish now. Haha~~
